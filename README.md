# defnk!

Small macro that wraps Clojure defn and allows keyword parameter checking. It will check that the parameter name matches and that it is filled.
There is no typechecking for parameter types and no multiple arities are allowed.

Requires metosin/malli since it uses it internally

Stage: Testing internally on product app.
